# Summary Page Architecture

## Overview
The summary page provides a multi-step reservation flow for NovaPods and packs, using a modular component architecture with the catalog as the single source of truth.

## Architecture Components

### 1. **Main Page** (`src/pages/summary.astro`)
- Entry point for the summary flow
- Renders the hero section with stepper
- Loads the step coordinator component

### 2. **Hero Section** (`src/components/summary/SummaryHeroSection.astro`)
- Enhanced stepper with animations and visual feedback
- Step progress indicator
- Responsive design with smooth transitions

### 3. **Step Coordinator** (`src/components/summary/SummaryStepCoordinator.astro`)
- Central coordinator for all step content
- Dynamically loads step content based on current step
- Manages step transitions and event handling
- Uses catalog data as single source of truth

### 4. **Shared Utilities** (`src/utils/summaryShared.js`)
- Centralized utilities for cart operations
- Pod and pack management
- UI updates and notifications
- Navigation and form handling
- Uses catalog data exclusively

### 5. **Catalog System** (`src/content/catalog/`)
- **Single source of truth** for all product data
- `_index.js` - Main catalog utilities and exports
- `_pods.js` - All pod data and operations
- `_packs.js` - All pack data and operations
- No hardcoded data or assumptions

## Data Flow

```
Catalog (Single Source) → Shared Utils → Step Coordinator → UI Components
```

### Catalog Data Structure
- **Pods**: Complete pod information with pricing, features, and metadata
- **Packs**: Complete pack information with pricing, categories, and metadata
- **Utilities**: Helper functions for cart operations and data retrieval

### Key Principles
1. **Single Source of Truth**: All data comes from the catalog
2. **No Hardcoded Data**: No assumptions or hardcoded values
3. **Modular Design**: Components are independent and reusable
4. **Event-Driven**: Components communicate via events
5. **Type Safety**: Proper data validation and error handling

## Step Flow

### Step 1: Choose Pod
- Loads available pods from catalog
- Shows selected pod if one exists in cart
- Allows pod selection, removal, and hire period adjustment
- Uses catalog data for all pod information

### Step 2: Add Packs
- Shows recommended packs for selected pod (from catalog)
- Falls back to all available packs if no recommendations
- Displays warning if no pod is selected
- Uses catalog data for all pack information

### Step 3: Reserve Pod
- Order summary with pod and pack details
- Contact form for reservation
- Total price calculation using catalog pricing
- Form submission handling

## Event System

### Step Navigation Events
- `step-changed`: Triggered when step changes
- `pod-selected`: Triggered when pod is selected
- `pack-added`: Triggered when pack is added
- `pack-removed`: Triggered when pack is removed

### Cart Events
- `cart-updated`: Triggered when cart changes
- `cart-cleared`: Triggered when cart is cleared

## Error Handling

### Data Validation
- Validates pod/pack existence in catalog
- Handles missing or invalid data gracefully
- Shows appropriate error messages

### Fallback Behavior
- Shows all packs if no recommendations exist
- Displays warning messages for missing selections
- Graceful degradation for missing data

## Performance Optimizations

### Lazy Loading
- Step content loaded on demand
- Catalog data cached after first load
- Efficient DOM updates

### Memory Management
- Event listeners properly cleaned up
- DOM elements cached where appropriate
- Minimal re-renders

## Testing

### Catalog Test (`src/utils/catalogTest.js`)
- Verifies catalog data integrity
- Tests utility functions
- Validates single source of truth

### Cart Test (`src/utils/cartTest.js`)
- Tests cart operations
- Validates data consistency
- Ensures proper error handling

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements
1. **Real-time Updates**: Live cart synchronization
2. **Advanced Filtering**: Category and price filtering
3. **Search Functionality**: Product search capabilities
4. **Analytics Integration**: User behavior tracking
5. **A/B Testing**: Step flow optimization

### Scalability Considerations
- Catalog data can be extended without code changes
- New product types can be added easily
- Component architecture supports feature additions
- Event system allows for loose coupling
