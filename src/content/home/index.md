faq:
  title: "Frequently Asked Questions"
  items:
    - question: "🤖 What exactly is a NovaPod?"
      answer: "A NovaPod is a hybrid delivery unit made up of expert humans and AI agents, purpose-built to execute your product or feature from start to finish. Think of it as a plug-and-play software team, but faster, smarter, and focused on outcomes."
    - question: "⏱️ How fast can a pod start working?"
      answer: "Most pods spin up within 48–72 hours. Once you select a pod and align on goals, we assign your team, set up tools, and start building immediately."
    - question: "⚙️ How is AI used inside a pod?"
      answer: "AI agents assist with code generation, testing, content, automation, and task management—speeding up delivery and reducing manual overhead. Humans always lead critical thinking and decisions, while AI accelerates execution."
    - question: "🎯 What kinds of outcomes can I expect?"
      answer: "Each pod is designed to deliver real, testable product outputs—like MVPs, features, automations, storefronts, AI tools, or design systems. We define clear milestones at the start and stay focused on shipping results, not hours."
    - question: "💼 Do I manage the pod or does NovaPod do it?"
      answer: "You don't need to manage individual resources. Every pod is self-managed by a pod lead, with clear communication and regular updates. You stay in control of the direction—without the management overhead."
    - question: "🔁 What if my needs change mid-project?"
      answer: "NovaPods are built to adapt. You can switch pods, add new capabilities, or scale your pod size depending on your evolving needs. Flexibility is baked in."
    - question: "💸 How does pricing work?"
      answer: "Pods are priced based on outcomes and complexity, not hourly rates. You'll get a fixed-price estimate upfront—no surprises, no runaway budgets. Add-on Packs are optional."
    - question: "📦 Can I add packs to my pod?"
      answer: "Yes! You can enhance any pod with add-on Packs like performance audits, UX reviews, AI agent setup, or QA automation. These are pre-scoped and plug right into your workflow."
    - question: "🛠️ Can I use NovaPod for just part of my project?"
      answer: "Absolutely. Whether you need a pod to handle frontend only, AI integration, or just DevOps setup—we can plug in at any stage."
    - question: "🧠 Who owns the code and IP?"
      answer: "You do. 100%. All code, assets, and deliverables created by your pod are fully handed over with clean documentation."
