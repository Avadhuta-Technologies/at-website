    items: [
      {
        question: "❓ How do packs differ from pods?",
        answer: "Pods are ongoing teams for long-term projects, while packs are fixed-scope deliverables for specific outcomes. Packs are perfect when you need a particular result—like launching a website or setting up analytics—without managing a team."
      },
      {
        question: "📆 What's the typical delivery timeline?",
        answer: "Most packs deliver in 1-4 weeks depending on complexity. We provide clear milestones and regular updates throughout the process."
      },
      {
        question: "💼 Can I customize a pack?",
        answer: "Yes! While packs have a defined scope, we can add specific features or integrations. We'll quote any additions transparently."
      },
      {
        question: "🔐 Do I own all the deliverables?",
        answer: "Absolutely. All code, designs, documentation, and assets are yours. We provide source files and transfer ownership completely."
