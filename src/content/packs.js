    title: "Frequently Asked Questions",
    subtitle: "Everything you need to know about our Fixed Scope Packs",
    items: [
      {
        question: "What exactly is a Pack?",
        answer: "A Pack is a fixed-scope, fixed-cost add-on that extends the capabilities of a Pod. It delivers a specific outcome ‚Äî like launching your product, adding automation, or improving UX ‚Äî in a defined time frame."
      },
      {
        question: "Do I need to buy a Pod to use a Pack?",
        answer: "Yes. Packs are designed to enhance or complement a Pod. Think of the Pod as your core service, and Packs as modular boosters that add extra value."
      },
      {
        question: "Can I combine multiple Packs with one Pod?",
        answer: "Absolutely. You can stack multiple Packs with a single Pod ‚Äî for example, combine a Launch Pack + Web Presence Pack + Brand Starter Pack with the Product Launch Pod."
      },
      {
        question: "Are the prices fixed or do they vary?",
        answer: "All Pack prices are fixed for the defined scope. If you need customizations beyond the listed deliverables, we can scope a Custom Pack for you."
      },
      {
        question: "How long does each Pack take to deliver?",
        answer: "Each Pack comes with a set delivery timeline (e.g., 1‚Äì4 weeks depending on the scope). Timelines are listed clearly with each Pack."
      },
      {
        question: "What happens after I choose a Pack?",
        answer: "Once you select a Pack, we'll schedule a short kickoff session to align on requirements. From there, our team gets started and keeps you updated throughout the delivery cycle."
      },
      {
        question: "Can I create a custom Pack?",
        answer: "Yes! If none of the standard Packs fit your needs, you can request a Custom Pack tailored to your goals. Just [Talk to a Specialist] to get started."
      },
      {
        question: "What if I only want a Pack but not a Pod?",
        answer: "Packs are designed to work with Pods, not independently. If you're unsure which Pod you need, we'll help you choose the right one for your goal."
