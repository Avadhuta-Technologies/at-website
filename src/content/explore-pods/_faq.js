    question: "How is this different from hiring freelancers or agencies?",
    answer:
      "Pods are structured, accountable, and built for long-term delivery. You don’t manage freelancers — you collaborate with a delivery partner who operates like your internal team."
  },
  {
    question: "What’s the minimum engagement?",

  },
  {
    question: "Who manages the team?",
    answer:
      "Every Pod comes with a Delivery Coordinator or Project Manager depending on the pod size. You get full visibility without micromanaging."
  },

    question: "Do I own the code and IP?",
