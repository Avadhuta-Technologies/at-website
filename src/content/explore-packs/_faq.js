      question: "What exactly is a Pack?",
      answer: "A Pack is a fixed-scope, fixed-cost add-on that extends the capabilities of a Pod. It delivers a specific outcome — like launching your product, adding automation, or improving UX — in a defined time frame."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need to buy a Pod to use a Pack?",
      answer: "Yes. Packs are designed to enhance or complement a Pod. Think of the Pod as your core service, and Packs as modular boosters that add extra value."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I combine multiple Packs with one Pod?",
      answer: "Absolutely. You can stack multiple Packs with a single Pod — for example, combine a Launch Pack + Web Presence Pack + Brand Starter Pack with the Product Launch Pod."
    },
    {
      question: "Are the prices fixed or do they vary?",
      answer: "All Pack prices are fixed for the defined scope. If you need customizations beyond the listed deliverables, we can scope a Custom Pack for you."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does each Pack take to deliver?",
      answer: "Each Pack comes with a set delivery timeline (e.g., 1–4 weeks depending on the scope). Timelines are listed clearly with each Pack."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens after I choose a Pack?",
      answer: "Once you select a Pack, we'll schedule a short kickoff session to align on requirements. From there, our team gets started and keeps you updated throughout the delivery cycle."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I create a custom Pack?",
      answer: "Yes! If none of the standard Packs fit your needs, you can request a Custom Pack tailored to your goals. Just Talk to a Specialist to get started."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I only want a Pack but not a Pod?",
      answer: "Packs are designed to work with Pods, not independently. If you're unsure which Pod you need, we'll help you choose the right one for your goal."
